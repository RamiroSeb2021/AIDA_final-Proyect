These difficulties can significantly impair the quality of one\\u2019s life.The difficulties you\\u2019re facing are common among adults with autism spectrum disorders. You should consult a mental health professional who specializes in adult autistic spectrum disorders. If possible, choose a therapist who is familiar with cognitive enhancement therapy (CET). CET is a relatively new treatment that trains individuals with autism spectrum disorders to have more positive social interactions. They do this by teaching individuals, among other things, how to identify social cues, how to take the perspective of another person and how to properly respond in a one-on-one conversation.If a CET-trained professional is not available, choose a therapist who has experience working with clients with problems similar to yours.If you have not done so already, consult a psychiatrist about your obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Medication could help you to better manage your symptoms. Please take care.\",\n          \"I understand why you are frustrated. Give yourself credit for wanting to respond to your friends\\u2019 feedback even though it was probably difficult to hear.I suggest a couple of things: First, do check with other friends to see if they agree that you sound patronizing. It\\u2019s just possible that the two friends who talked to you are particularly sensitive to tone of voice and that others don\\u2019t agree.If most of your friends and family generally agree that you do sound condescending, choose someone you especially trust and ask them to imitate what they hear when you speak to them so you can better understand what they are talking about. Then role play different ways to say the same thing until you both agree that you have found a correction. Practice will bring how you speak in line with what you intend to say.I wish you well. \",\n          \" I am very glad you are writing us and asking your question.

You are obviously a good student, and the school counselor will be able to help you bring some of these anxieties under control. The first thing to do is talk about it with someone you trust.

I have normal relationships and what not, but I don\\u2019t talk about what\\u2019s going on in my life. And well, like I said, this therapist, he listens!! And I don\\u2019t know how it started, but now I\\u2019m attracted to him and think about him all the time. Yikes! And I had therapy the other day and I was feeling a bit awkward sometimes because in my head I was thinking about him sexually!! And he was right there in front of me. Not good but so good at the same time! But yeah nothing will happen anyway because 1. he\\u2019s my therapist and that goes against code and 2. he\\u2019s married anyway. But it doesn\\u2019t stop me from thinking about him that way. I don\\u2019t know if I have control over my actions but don\\u2019t want to lose him as a therapist! And if I ask him for help about it, I guess I probably will. I can\\u2019t ask anyway\\u2026 too awkward. And I don\\u2019t want to start again with a new therapist. So please give me some ideas! Oh, and if this helps in anyway, I have bipolar\\u2026. but I guess I\\u2019m not the first person in the world to be attracted to my therapist so maybe it doesn\\u2019t! (18 year old female who recently started therapy)\",\n          \"My best friend had a terrible car accident 4 months ago with serious brain damage and head injuries, all the doctors said he would not make it, they said they are only waiting for him to die or stay in coma, and that there is nothing left to do. At that time i was absolutely devastated and had a really hard time. He was in a coma for about a month, however after a few successful surgeries he started waking up, and against all odds he survived. Injuries he suffered were great, but now, after 4 months, he is slowly recovering, he learned how to walk again, he recognizes his family and me, his long-term memory is more or less ok. However, his short-term memory is pretty bad, and because of the accident he cant open his eyes, and it is not sure whether he will be able to see again in his life. We are best friends from college, I live in Slovakia, he lives in Czech republic, so we were able to see each other only when in school, but we were always together, whether in school or when we were going out to bars etc. He is recovering in Czech republic, I am currently living in Slovakia, so I cannot see him that often. The problem is, i thought i got use to the fact that he is no longer going to school with me and that I am not seeing him regularly. However, he likes to talk on the phone (of course he is confused some times), and whenever his family calls me and I talk to them and to him, I start to shiver, shake, suddenly I am feeling cold and it takes my body about half an hour to relax. This is nothing serious, but I thought I am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better. But just a few days ago, when his family called me (after nearly a month or so), I immediately started to shake and experience these feelings again. I would like to know what to do, or how to get over this anxiety, i want to be helpful to my friend, and not feel this weak whenever I talk to him. Thank you\",\n          \"I will try and establish all of my issues directly; I am currently seeing a therapist, who I frequently lie to. 1) I cannot sleep through the night and subsequently spend all day and most of the night on the Internet. Once I get to sleep I will sleep until midday. 2) I have a very big sexual appetite that no one is able to fill. I speak with a multitude of women online and love the detachment, I treat them badly. Say sexually explicit things and enjoy that. I then turn it on them. I enjoy that. It makes me laugh a lot. Pathetic and desperate dumb bitches. 3) I am no longer employed. 4) I live at home with my father. Parents have been divorced for years. I believe this is why I never want to get married. 5) I have an extreme fear of commitment and insist on sexual relationships that do not include kissing or hugging (anything remotely emotional) 6) I am highly intelligent. I tell people that I am better than them. However I really hate myself, I frequently consider suicide. 7) I have come from a wealthy upbringing, however expectations are unreal. 8) I have very few friends. I spend a lot of time alone. Going out with family is something I cannot be bothered to do. 9) I am bored, feel nothing excepting extreme anger, frustration and guilt. 10) I have done morally representable things. 11) I have no issue fighting and making others feel bad. Until I feel guilt for it. 12) I smoke, but do not drink heavily nor do drugs at all. 13) I was bullied when I was in school 14) I feel alone. I rode my motorcycle to feel the rush, it was fun. Then I crashed it and couldn\\u2019t get it fixed. 15) I have no one to turn to, and am constantly emotionally and physically alone. 16) I think highly of my sister and my brother. She is caring he is not. 17) My mother has always been distant.

These difficulties can significantly impair the quality of one\\u2019s life.The difficulties you\\u2019re facing are common among adults with autism spectrum disorders. You should consult a mental health professional who specializes in adult autistic spectrum disorders. If possible, choose a therapist who is familiar with cognitive enhancement therapy (CET). CET is a relatively new treatment that trains individuals with autism spectrum disorders to have more positive social interactions. They do this by teaching individuals, among other things, how to identify social cues, how to take the perspective of another person and how to properly respond in a one-on-one conversation.If a CET-trained professional is not available, choose a therapist who has experience working with clients with problems similar to yours.If you have not done so already, consult a psychiatrist about your obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

It\\u2019s just possible that the two friends who talked to you are particularly sensitive to tone of voice and that others don\\u2019t agree.If most of your friends and family generally agree that you do sound condescending, choose someone you especially trust and ask them to imitate what they hear when you speak to them so you can better understand what they are talking about.

I have normal relationships and what not, but I don\\u2019t talk about what\\u2019s going on in my life. And well, like I said, this therapist, he listens!! And I don\\u2019t know how it started, but now I\\u2019m attracted to him and think about him all the time. Yikes! And I had therapy the other day and I was feeling a bit awkward sometimes because in my head I was thinking about him sexually!! And he was right there in front of me. Not good but so good at the same time! But yeah nothing will happen anyway because 1. he\\u2019s my therapist and that goes against code and 2. he\\u2019s married anyway. But it doesn\\u2019t stop me from thinking about him that way. I don\\u2019t know if I have control over my actions but don\\u2019t want to lose him as a therapist! And if I ask him for help about it, I guess I probably will. I can\\u2019t ask anyway\\u2026 too awkward. And I don\\u2019t want to start again with a new therapist. So please give me some ideas!

(18 year old female who recently started therapy)\",\n          \"My best friend had a terrible car accident 4 months ago with serious brain damage and head injuries, all the doctors said he would not make it, they said they are only waiting for him to die or stay in coma, and that there is nothing left to do. At that time i was absolutely devastated and had a really hard time. He was in a coma for about a month, however after a few successful surgeries he started waking up, and against all odds he survived. Injuries he suffered were great, but now, after 4 months, he is slowly recovering, he learned how to walk again, he recognizes his family and me, his long-term memory is more or less ok. However, his short-term memory is pretty bad, and because of the accident he cant open his eyes, and it is not sure whether he will be able to see again in his life. We are best friends from college, I live in Slovakia, he lives in Czech republic, so we were able to see each other only when in school, but we were always together, whether in school or when we were going out to bars etc. He is recovering in Czech republic, I am currently living in Slovakia, so I cannot see him that often. The problem is, i thought i got use to the fact that he is no longer going to school with me and that I am not seeing him regularly. However, he likes to talk on the phone (of course he is confused some times), and whenever his family calls me and I talk to them and to him, I start to shiver, shake, suddenly I am feeling cold and it takes my body about half an hour to relax. This is nothing serious, but I thought I am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better. But just a few days ago, when his family called me (after nearly a month or so), I immediately started to shake and experience these feelings again. I would like to know what to do, or how to get over this anxiety, i want to be helpful to my friend, and not feel this weak whenever I talk to him. Thank you\",\n          \"I will try and establish all of my issues directly; I am currently seeing a therapist, who I frequently lie to. 1) I cannot sleep through the night and subsequently spend all day and most of the night on the Internet. Once I get to sleep I will sleep until midday. 2) I have a very big sexual appetite that no one is able to fill. I speak with a multitude of women online and love the detachment, I treat them badly. Say sexually explicit things and enjoy that. I then turn it on them. I enjoy that. It makes me laugh a lot. Pathetic and desperate dumb bitches. 3) I am no longer employed. 4) I live at home with my father. Parents have been divorced for years. I believe this is why I never want to get married. 5) I have an extreme fear of commitment and insist on sexual relationships that do not include kissing or hugging (anything remotely emotional) 6) I am highly intelligent. I tell people that I am better than them. However I really hate myself, I frequently consider suicide. 7) I have come from a wealthy upbringing, however expectations are unreal. 8) I have very few friends. I spend a lot of time alone. Going out with family is something I cannot be bothered to do. 9) I am bored, feel nothing excepting extreme anger, frustration and guilt. 10) I have done morally representable things. 11) I have no issue fighting and making others feel bad. Until I feel guilt for it. 12) I smoke, but do not drink heavily nor do drugs at all. 13) I was bullied when I was in school 14) I feel alone. I rode my motorcycle to feel the rush, it was fun. Then I crashed it and couldn\\u2019t get it fixed. 15) I have no one to turn to, and am constantly emotionally and physically alone. 16) I think highly of my sister and my brother. She is caring he is not. 17) My mother has always been distant.

In everyday practice, that would mean consistently enduring and tolerating anxiety-producing situations rather than fleeing them. But there\\u2019s no reason to do this alone. Professional help can expedite the intervention process and provide support that will help you to overcome your fears.At 23, you are still very young. You are not that far away from where you want to be. Based on what you wrote, your goals are to get your driver\\u2019s license and get a job. With treatment, those are very achievable goals. It might only take a few counseling sessions for you to begin to get your anxiety under control. At that point, you might feel ready to do the things that you have been wanting to do. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care. Please take care.\",\n          \"It is unusual to be attracted to children. It\\u2019s good that you have not acted upon these urges but you can\\u2019t think of them as normal. People are not commonly attracted to children. It is outside the norm. Anything outside the norm is abnormal.Approximately 1% of the male population is sexually attracted to children. The latest iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health Disorders, makes a distinction between pedophiles who desire sex with children and those who act on their desires. Just because an individual has an unusual, erotic interest doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean they have a mental health disorder.But not everyone agrees. As [ORG] argues in [ORG], pedophilia is a mental health disorder and we should acknowledge it as such (rather than as a crime). She goes on to say that it\\u2019s not only the right thing to do but such a recognition would advance the efforts of protecting children.There are individuals who live with pedophilia but don\\u2019t act on it. There are even websites that provide support for people who are attracted to children but (they claim) would never have sex with a child. They say they know it\\u2019s wrong but just want support from other people with similar affections.Some recent research suggests that pedophilia is not a choice. MRIs of sex offenders with pedophilia show abnormal levels of white matter in their brains. Men with pedophilia are three times more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous than non-pedophiles. They also score lower on tests of visual-spatial ability and verbal memory.A 2015 Swedish study analyzed over 21,000 convicted sex offenders. The researchers were trying to answer the question of whether sex offending runs in families. It was their contention that it does and their explanation was that genetics (and not environmental factors such as family members learning it from one another) played a big role in whether or not someone engages in sex offending behavior.This attraction just started in your 30s. No one can predict how it will change. It was not always there. It was not there in the first 30 years of your life. It\\u2019s important to investigate why this attraction has developed and how to prevent it from growing stronger.You should see a therapist to look for an explanation and how to handle it. Hopefully, therapy can eliminate these urges and most importantly, prevent you from acting upon them. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It could be that the diagnosis was made when he was still a teen and that he has developed to the point that he no longer meets the criteria for ASPD. From your report, I\\u2019m guessing that\\u2019s the case. But that\\u2019s only a guess on the basis of your letter.If he no longer has the symptoms of ASPD, he can inform his parents and maybe they can relax. If they persist in trying to separate the two of you, then it is likely that something else is going on, in which case, he needs to have a difficult but important conversation with them about why they are concerned.I wish you well.\",\n          \"Only an in-person evaluation could determine if you have schizophrenia or any other mental health disorder. If you are hearing voices and having hallucinations then you need to be evaluated as soon as possible. [ORG] and related psychotic disorders may be the cause of the voices and visions but these disorders are rare in children. There are other possibilities. Please report your experiences to your parents immediately. They need to know that you are having such experiences. If you don\\u2019t report this information to them, then they will be unable to help you. If reporting this information to your parents is not an option, then report it to another trusted adult such as a trusted family member, school guidance counselor, nurse, principal, teacher, clergyman, etc. The most important aspect of this issue is that you seek help and be evaluated.On rare occasions, individuals report hearing voices or \\u201cseeing dead people\\u201d and believe that they have psychic or mediumship abilities. There is a television show devoted entirely to this topic called Psychic Kids. I am in no way suggesting that you are psychic or that what you are experiencing is supernatural in nature. I am simply observant of the fact that individuals who claim to be psychic or to have mediumship abilities often claim to \\u201csee dead people.\\u201dThe best way to handle the situation is to be evaluated by a mental health professional. It is important to determine what is causing you to have such frightening experiences and to find a way to decrease or eliminate the voices and hallucinations. Delusions and hallucinations can also be caused by medical problems and this is why it is so important that you receive an evaluation. Speak to your parents immediately.

      "Pregunta: hello i’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and a half. we have some issues which made me think that he is not trying hard to save our relationship. i’ll number the problems so that it will be easier to read:\n",
      "Respuesta: thank you for offering such a detailed description of your relationship. the overall nature of this relationship seems to be an ongoing struggle where you are wanting him to be more available emotionally and geographically — but your anxiety about the relationship prevents you from feeling secure. in other words, if we take the entire time that you’re together, a great quantity of it is spent with you worrying about the relationship rather than enjoying it. since this has been the case for such a long time, it means that the very foundation of the relationship has emotional and geographical distance built into it. my experience is that these relationships are difficult because once the person is available the couple is often lost as to how to function together. while there is some new recent evidence to suggest that long-distance relationships may work, they work when there is a very powerful ongoing commitment to being available, to have a variety of experiences mixed into the relationship, and to share vulnerability. it seems as if these components were not present in this relationship.i think you need to have a very open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about whether the relationship is meeting both your needs. if it isn’t, do[gpe] defer to some far-off future time when it may. relationships need to be nurtured in the moment, not constantly deferred for gratification.wishing you patience and peace,\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ejemplo 2:\n",
      "Pregunta: from a teen in the [gpe]: my parents have been divorced since i was 2 years old. i moved away from home this past fall for college. since then my parents have been communicating through me. they constantly call me and rant about the other as well as tell me to relay messages.\n",
      "Respuesta: i understand why you feel trapped in this pattern. your parents would rather make you responsible than accept responsibility for themselves. being a responsible person, you can’t let things drop. however, it is part of growing up to set boundaries with parents and to separate from destructive family patterns.regardless of other issues, it is your right to refuse to talk to your parents about their complaints with each other. remind them that they got a divorce for good reasons and there is no point in continuing their fight with each other through you. then change the subject. if they won’t change the subject, tell them a polite “good bye” with the comment that you’ll be glad to hear from them when they want to talk about something else.i am aware that some of the things your parents want you to deal with are too important to abandon without putting something in place. for example: you didn’t mention how old your sister is. if she is a teen, it’s time for her to take responsibility for managing her disease since her parents can’t or won’t. talk with her about how she is coping with the self-discipline that is required for good diabetes management. encourage her to have a talk with her endocrinologist and perhaps to seek out a support group for young people who are dealing with diabetes. if necessary, remind her that refusing to take care of herself is not at all likely to get her parents to change. it really is up to her to do what she needs to do to have a long and happy life.as for things like your financial aid: do talk with the [org] office at your school to see if there is any way they can get you out of the middle by dealing with your parents directly.if you find that you just can’t extricate yourself, please do consider seeing a therapist for support.i wish you well.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ejemplo 3:\n",
      "Pregunta: i am 25 years old and i have been with my boyfriend for almost a year and a half now. we met at work and we spend almost every day together. for the most part, our relationship is very healthy — we balance each other out very well. he brings out the character in my personality and we both help each other think critically. he makes me laugh a lot and we’re always there to support each other — he’s a great companion. we argue about once a month (the time of the month for me) over silly issues but we’re generally very good about solving them.\n",
      "Respuesta: three years ago, your boyfriend and his ex were maybe 20 or 21. they made some poor decisions when they were very young and suffered a tragedy together. it’s now part of the fabric of who they are. nothing you can do is going to change that. your boyfriend has done his grieving for the baby and for what might have been and moved on as best he can. but as with all important griefs, when it is put in front of him, some of the intense feelings still come over him. of course he cries. that’s normal and appropriate. it only shows that he is a good, caring man who has had a loss. you wouldn’t want him to be anything less.loving him means appreciating that and understanding that his past is, of course, always going to be a part of your life as well as his. if you do make a future with him and decide to have children, your pregnancy will not be his first. he will have memories of another. he will probably be extra concerned about you during your pregnancy and extra worried about whether your baby is okay. the birth of his first child with you will be inevitably colored with feelings from the loss of the other child. he will probably love the children you have together all the more because he understands as most of us don’t just how precious life is.the problem with dating grownups is that they have lived a life before you met them. so have you. each of us is the sum of our experiences (both good and bad), including our experiences with others. if you can’t tolerate these ideas, then you shouldn’t be with someone who has been with anyone before you. as you get older, that will become more and more of a challenge though. for that reason, i do think it would be helpful for you to think about doing a little therapy. you have what you say is a wonderful relationship with a caring man who loves you enough to put up with your really low comments and accusations when you fight. at this point, it’s your insecurities that may sink this relationship, not his past. you risk throwing away a perfectly fine relationship because you are preoccupied with things you can’t change or accept. you need to figure out what that is about and resolve it if you are ever to have a happy and relaxed relationship with any partner. i hope you agree that you owe that to yourself.i wish you well.\n",

      "Pregunta: about a year ago i developed severe anxiety and had several panic attacks a day. over time i developed more and more symptoms such as intrusive thoughts etc. however after quite some time i developed very worrying symptoms that make me think i am developing schiz/psychosis.\n",
      "Respuesta: it’s common for people with anxiety to believe that they are developing schizophrenia. as i’ve said many times in this column, it is one of the most common questions that i receive here at [org]. people with anxiety disorders tend to believe that the worst will happen to them. in the minds of many people, schizophrenia is the worst case scenario and thus they worry that they’re going to develop it.the fact that you were evaluated by mental health professionals and were diagnosed with anxiety disorders would indicate that you do not have schizophrenia or a related disorder. your fears about schizophrenia are likely a symptom of your anxiety disorders. it was likely something that your evaluators recognized and factored into their evaluation and diagnosis.it’s also important to remember that their opinion is objective. your opinion, however, is not. your views are being filtered through fear. fear clouds judgment which can lead to incorrect conclusions.your evaluators likely recommended treatment. anxiety disorders are highly responsive to treatment. cognitive behavioral therapy and medication are effective treatments for anxiety disorders.in the meantime, it’s important to believe in facts. they will help you stay grounded in reality which will ultimately decrease your anxiety. it is factual to state that you were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and not a psychotic disorder. that should ease your anxiety. believing in truth and reality is the best way to ease anxiety. that’s something you will learn in counseling.treatment will help you tremendously. i hope you will try it.\n",

      "Pregunta: from the [gpe]: ever since i can remember, i have had people telling me to sit down and stop fidgeting. i had thought if i could bottle my “nervous energy,” i’d be rich!!\n",
      "Respuesta: sure. in your long letter, you never mention getting a mental health evaluation. maybe you have. if so, you may need to get a second opinion. what i know for sure, is that you have suffered for a very long time and you deserve to get some answers and some direction. at 49, you have lived at least half your life. you can take charge and make the rest of your life be happier and more successful.i can’t even venture a diagnosis. there is so much in your letter. but a mental health counselor can. fortunately, you do live in an area where there are services people who are struggling financially. go to: [url] are also many programs to help people get on their feet. take a look at this website: [url] made an important first step by writing to us. now please be your own best friend and contact people locally who can give you the help you need.i wish you well.\n",

It always who can do what first. Then we notice that their side of the family doing all these things for their baby and not ours.if we happen to go visit them, and someone asks about our baby, someone always brings up the other baby and that the other baby “does it bigger” basically. And they are always all over my sister in laws belly, never once mine. They have literally cried over feeling her belly, never even touched mine once. No one ever asks how my baby is doing. I just want it to be equal, and I don’t know what to do. I need some serious advice. I don’t want this to continue when both the babies are here (which will be very soon), I don’t want my child noticing it either.',\n",
       " 'Answer_anon': 'Thank you for explaining this situation. How unfortunate that this share joyous event is turning into a competition.The experience of being left out or ignored as part of the situation is what needs to be addressed. First, I would have a talk with your fiancé about what is happening and why. Does the family have a bias against the pregnancy because you were not married first? Is your fiancé on the outs with his family? Do they have a resentment against you for some reason? The key to understanding why this is happening is in understanding the reasons behind it. Of course, they may be superficial reasons or unconscious ones, but having a talk with your fiancé about this may be helpful in uncovering being slighted. This can also help decide the best mode of action for remediation.The fact that they are treating you both so differently may not be something they are consciously aware of. As a way of fostering a connection, I would include yourself into the mix and have your fiancé facilitate this. If they are touching her belly and not yours inviting them to feel the baby might be something you and your fiancé can offer. Join in the attention to your future sister-in-law and invite her to share time and information with you. Make yourself and your willingness to engage known to them.It way also help for you to take on a role where you are asking questions of your sister-in-law or other members of the family. You having this need from them may be part of what shifts the dynamic. Discussing this with your future husband can give you both a sense of connection during this, as well as support.Anxiety during pregnancy about, well, everything, is a well-known phenomenon.

Thank you for writing.I ask you to consider this: It’s likely that you did not have the impact on the therapist that you thought you did. She moved on to a new job. You are the one who cancelled appointments and didn’t give the two of you the opportunity to terminate well.In my opinion, it is possible that you skew new information to fit your idea of yourself. This is called “assimilation”. Assimilation is when people fit new information into their existing ideas of themselves and the world.Such beliefs are called “schemas” by theorist [PERSON]. Everyone has such schemas. It is how we categorize and process new information. If we didn’t have them, we would be overwhelmed by every new thing we see, learn, and experience. [GPE] give us something to go on as we try to understand new facts, opinions, and ideas. It is so much easier to modify new information to fit our existing beliefs than to change our beliefs, whether those beliefs are positive or negative.You have an idea of yourself as someone other people will ultimately abandon. I’m guessing you are so sensitive to that possibility, that you see abandonment when people need to leave you (like your therapist), regardless of the reality. Fearing abandonment, just waiting for the “other shoe to drop”, you provoke the very abandonment you fear or interpret something someone says or does as further evidence that you are a person that other people leave.One of the ways you preserve some self-esteem is to see yourself as powerful; as having permanent impact on others’ ability to trust. That may be true in some cases, but it is unlikely that you have that much impact on others, especially on an experienced therapist.I suggest you get back into therapy. Take your letter and this response, whether or not you agree with me, to the first appointment. It will give the new therapist an immediate understanding of where to begin.You haven’t yet given up on yourself. Don’t start now. Make that appointment.
