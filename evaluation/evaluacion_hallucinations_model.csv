psychology,I feel very anxious lately. What can I do to manage my anxiety?,"There are a few things that you can try: 1. Seek out a therapist. I think that talking to someone who can help you understand your situation and give you tools to deal with your anxiety will be very helpful. 2. Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness is a way of being present and aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It can help you to be more aware of your thoughts and feelings and to respond to them more calmly. 3. Take care of yourself. Eating well, getting enough sleep, and getting regular exercise are all important ways to maintain good health. It is also important to make time for things that you enjoy, such as hobbies, volunteering, or spending time with family and friends. 4. Get enough sleep. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Getting less than 5 hours of sleep can make you feel even more anxious. 5.",

off_topic,Who won the FIFA World Cup in 1998?,"I don’t know. I’m a psychologist, not a sports writer.
